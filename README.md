# Image-Classifier
Image Classification with CNN (TensorFlow, OpenCV):
Built a Convolutional Neural Network using TensorFlow to classify CIFAR-10 images into 10 categories. Trained the model on 30,000 images, achieving strong accuracy on test data. Deployed the model to:

Predict static images with visualization (Matplotlib)

Perform real-time classification via webcam (OpenCV)

Used ReLU activations, Adam optimizer, and saved the model in .h5 format for reuse.
